# SYSTEM NAME: QUALITY EVALUATION AND ANTI-CHEATING
## RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS REPOSITY

This is the resposity to manage submodules of the whole system. All teams will create own reposity of your team and reference that reposity to this reposity and work like normal 

## RULE TO WORK
All reposity will have a main branch usually called `master` and that branch is only pushed in the first time. The new function of your model will be pushed in other branch that seperate from `master`. Only when the `function must be fined`, you just only merge it to master.

## FINALLY ROLE
After you read this `README.md` file. Don't push anything in this reposity





# HAVE A NICE DAY!
